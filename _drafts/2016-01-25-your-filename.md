For the past few months I've been wanting to expand my portfolio. The seminars and code schools offered by various greek universities participating in the [FOSS Centers of Excellence](https://ma.ellak.gr/) program, have helped me a lot with that. I made some minor contributions to existing open source software([edx](https://www.edx.org/), [stork](https://www.eid-stork.eu/))during some team projects and made some projects of my own ([TinyCollab](https://github.com/faysvas/TinyCollab) and right after that a [java project](https://github.com/faysvas/Ekdhlwseis) (*after coding TinyCollab day and night for five days, I can't say I was completely...focused when coding this one.* )).

I was also surprised pleasantly when my pitch towards a learning application for browsing animals and plants according to their taxonomy, ([BioTaxonomy](https://github.com/ellak-monades-aristeias/BioTaxonomy) - *my proudest achievement so far!*) was accepted and funded by the Greek Free/Open Source Software Society ([GFOSS](https://eellak.ellak.gr)). Creating BioTaxonomy was an amazing experience. It was the first time that I designed something that was truly my own, with requirements set by me instead of a client or employer.

It was the first time I used Bootstrap and jQuery extensively for a project so it was mostly a learning process. 

But the learning process isn't over. After trying out various programming and scripting languages,
