To take a break from the template's graphical elements I'm going to focus on the template's typography. Typography is one of those sneaky things that you can easily overlook when doing a design. Good typography can make a blog satisfying to view and read while bad typography, on the other hand, will make you feel that something is slightly off, but you just can't pinpoint what.   

I never payed attention to typography. I just chose a few fonts I liked and played around with sizes.
