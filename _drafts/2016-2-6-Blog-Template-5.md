When I started making the template I dived straight into design issues. Now I'll take a step back to look at semantics. A blog without semantic html 5 markup is just a bunch of disorderly divs. Semantic markup helps you make some sense out of all that information. Semantic markup is so important when making a blog template because it helps with refactoring and editing, and it's just so much more pleasurable to read.

To take a break from the template's graphical elements I'm going to focus on the template's typography. Typography is one of those sneaky things that you can easily overlook when doing a design. Good typography can make a blog satisfying to view and read while bad typography, on the other hand, will make you feel that something is slightly off, but you just can't pinpoint what.   

When I first started designing as part of developing, I never really payed attention to typography. I just chose a few fonts I liked and played around with sizes. Before reading articles on typography I thought that typography was just about font families and font sizes. Reading all the details fascinated me. 

Typography is fascinating but all those small details are too much for somebody who doesn't focus only on design. Luckily, I found the perfect guide for my project, an [Interactive Guide to Blog Typography](http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/#section/1). I'll follow each step and work on the design for large screens (I'll work on smaller screens later). 
- Layout: I'll give each article and each article header some extra margin-bottom.  
- Measure: The guide suggest 65 characters. I'm currently at 70 so I'll either just keep it or increase the font size a bit. 
- Line Height
