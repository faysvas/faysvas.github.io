### Front End-Development
Years a web developer could do everything. Program client side and server side. But with the rise of web technologies there are just too many things for one person to do. So now Web Developers are roughly divided in three categories:     

* Front-End: Someone who codes the client side of a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
* Back-End: Someone who specializes in server side coding, PHP, node.js, Java 
* Full-Stack: Someone who does both


I can do some basick back-end developing but I'm mainly a front-end developer(One of my favourite challenges when making an app is trying to find out how much I can do with pure client-side programming). But now thinThe [Front-End Handbook](http://www.frontendhandbook.com/) gave me the best help. It contains almost every detail of front-end developing, helping you find your strength and weaknesses. Front-End development is so diverse and broad that you can rarely find two front-end developers that know the same things.
