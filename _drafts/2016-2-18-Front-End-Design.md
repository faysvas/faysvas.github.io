##Study Topics
I feel that it's time I levelled up. After deciding to settle on Javascript (and ignore the sirens of other trendier languages) I made a decision to be a true master. The kind of master that answers the difficult stack overflow questions instead of the grovelling minion that *scours* for information frantically typing various search terms hoping to get lucky. I understand that's a long path 
###Algorithms
I started studying algorithms again. I'm rusty after finishing uni. I let my knowledge of algorithms slip. When working on projects I was mainly focused on getting the job done because that was the only thing that mattered to a fresh university graduate. That meant using libraries instead of trying to make everything myself and copying code snippets from stack overflow and various other places.  
I started reading about algorithms...and it's so exciting! A freeCodeCamper Xristos Kokkolios gathered some resources on his [blog](http://railswalker.com/extra-resources-for-free-code-camp/)(don't let his username fool you, there's a lot of javascript stuff here). I'll be checking them out one by one. He has [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). Such a well written and eloquent book. I read it as bedtime story. I like his style, it explains stuff but not in a dry technical way, but using beautiful language. 

I tried codefights and codewars. The easier problems teach me something new and the harder ones leave me completely dumbfounded. 

Apart from Algorithms I decide to study Javascript. I thouhght I knew Javascript in and out. After all, I can easily make any type of web application. Reading eloquent javascript I found out that I do NOT know javascript. I know how to use javascript blocks to make my apps but I don't really know javascript. I never knew it had such capabilities. 

I feel like a student again. 

###Front End-Development
Lately I've been trying to brand myself. I claim to be a full-stack developer but I lean more towards front-end. 
The [Front-End Handbook](http://www.frontendhandbook.com/) gave me the best help. It contains almost every detail of front-end developing, helping you find your strength and weaknesses. Front-End development is so diverse and broad that you can rarely find two front-end developers that know the same things.  

Front end development jobs are on the rise. 

##FreeCodeCamp
I've completed two frontend projects for freeCodeCamp, a [Portfolio](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/BjVdvN) page and a [Random Quote Machine](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/obJGMp). I'm not that satisfied with the portfolio design. I want to add a parallax effect on top like the example project. I used [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) for the first time. At first glance it looks prettier and easier to use than bootstrap. It offers more styling choices out of the box and it's style generally looks like the style I tried to achieve with bootstrap. 

The [Athens Free Code Camp](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.athens.greece) is very active. I've learned tons of stuff just by reviewing their projects (And having them review mine, there's nothing better than constructive feedback).

I'm also a regular article writer for GFOSS now. I'll try to write and article every 15 days. I wrote an article about alternate block chains. It seems like a groundbreaking technology. 

I've also made it a point to study and learn the basics of Angular because it seems this framework is everywhere nowadays. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of functionality and unecessarily reinventing the wheel for everything I do.
