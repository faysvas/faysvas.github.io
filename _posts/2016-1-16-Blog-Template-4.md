Now that I've made a basic layout I'll work on the scrolling. My friend wanted the sidebar to be static when scrolling. [Stickyfill](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sticky-positioning-with-nothing-but-css--cms-24042) is a very simple solution. It's a sticky polyfill for browsers that don't support position:sticky.   

Looking for ideas I found a piece of paper with tape that would make a good header (I still have to make it responsive and maybe try to recreate it with css). I think I'm starting to settle on a paper theme for this template. The sidebar will probably be a piece of paper (or multiple strips) too. Or maybe a filing folder containing each item.  

I talked with my friend about having the menu items appear as taped or pinned pieces of paper and she agreed, asking for each menu item to be a different colour. There are two ways I can do that: Either save some images of the paper with different colours or uss css filters. [Filter](http://bennettfeely.com/filters/) are worth looking at but the specific filter I want to use (hue) doesn't satisfy me for this picture. Anyway, the picture is very small so having 3 or 4 copies of it isn't so bad(I might try out filters later out of curiosity though).
