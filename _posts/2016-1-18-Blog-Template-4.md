Now that I've made a basic layout I'll work on the scrolling. My friend wanted the sidebar to be static when scrolling. [Stickyfill](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sticky-positioning-with-nothing-but-css--cms-24042) is a very simple solution. It's a polyfill for browsers that don't support `position:sticky` .   

While browsing pictures for ideas I found a piece of paper with tape that would make a good header (I still have to make it responsive and maybe try to recreate it with css). I think I'm starting to settle on a paper theme for this template. The sidebar will probably be a piece (or multiple strips)  of paper too. Maybe even a filing folder containing each item.  

I talked with my friend about having the menu items appear as taped or pinned pieces of paper and she agreed, asking for each menu item to be a different colour. There are two ways I can do that: 

 1. Save a different image for each colour  
 2. Use css filters

[Filters](http://bennettfeely.com/filters/) are worth looking at but the specific filter I want to use (hue) doesn't satisfy me for this specific picture. Anyway, the picture is very small so having 3 or 4 copies of it isn't so bad(I might try filters later out of curiosity though). 

Time to take a look at the template's fonts. The blog is going to be in greek so my first stop is [AKA-ACID](http://www.aka-acid.com/), the best place to find free greek hand-drawn fonts.  [Consider](http://www.consider.gr/greek-fonts/) is another site with a great free greek font collection. I'm looking for fonts that are whimiscal but easy to read.
