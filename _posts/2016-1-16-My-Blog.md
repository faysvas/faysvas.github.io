Before working any more on my friend's blog template I decided to improve my own blog's appearance first. Luckily many people have already made [jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/). I chose [Mediator](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/mediator/). [Typewriter](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/typewriter/) has a stack of papers for the article body, which might work for my friend's template. 

I checked it out to see how it was done, expecting a background picture but it was made with...css pseudo elements? I knew I could use pseudo classes for getting focus or an nth child  or something similar but had no idea I could use it to add things to the page without using stacks of `<div>` tags. This [article](https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/) has some examples of the things you can do with them.
