For every project I start the most difficult part is just that: getting started. I try to figure out how to make the cleanest, most structured code but the ugly truth is that[Reality is messy](http://www.the-haystack.com/2016/01/05/reality-is-messy/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-197&utm_medium=email). 
 
After googling "blogger template from scratch", I found some nice tutorials to follow for the template ([tutorial one](http://www.codedodle.com/2014/10/blogger-template-design-scratch-section-widget.html), [tutorial two](https://subinsb.com/make-a-blank-blogger-template), [tutorial three](http://www.nagekar.com/2015/06/creating-custom-blogger-template-from.html)). A blogger template is basically an XHTML page with some special tags (found [here](https://support.google.com/blogger/topic/6321969?hl=en&ref_topic=3369773)). So first I'll design the page layout and then add the appropriate tags. 

My first thought was to use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) like I always do but I think bootstrap offers a lot of functionality that ultimately won't be needed. Plus I'll probably spend a lot of time changing the look of every element. [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) is simple enough for this project.
